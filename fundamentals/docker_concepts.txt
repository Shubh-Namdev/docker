Docker Fundamentals


1) Need of Docker ?
   dependencies problems, configurations issues, env settings, microservices

2) What is docker ?
   builds, runs, ships, 
   use containers
   multiples applications we can run, 
   we can remove, 
   no burden to have application related configuration on our systems

3) Vms?
   multiple isolated env on same host,
   it will require copy of host os,
   slower,
   needs resources memory/cpu

   containers ?
   isolated env,
   light weight as compared to vms,
   faster as share same host os
    
4) Docker Architecture
   client server,
   The server is called as Docker engine,
   
5) Docker workflow 
   code repo but with docker file,
   docker file will contain all the require dependencies etc,
   docker files will be converted to docker image,
   docker images will be containing all stuff which is require for a container to run,
   next we can run a container using images,
   once image has been generated, we can register it to docker registry,
   anyone can access these images and directly run these as a container
